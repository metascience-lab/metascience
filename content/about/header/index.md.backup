<!-- this is a subheadline -->
Our Meta-science Research Lab is the nexus for research on the `Science of Science`, `Science Policy`, and `Scientometrics` at the iSchool of University of Wisconsin-Madison :us:.

We study complex data to identify insights for accelerating research advances, cultivating a competitive scientific workforce, and facilitating scientific knowledge transfer. Our goal is to provide evidence to inform policies and practices on effective scientific resource allocation, strategy development, and infrastructure building.

I'm a Hugo theme you'll want to hang out with. :fr: 

The page you are reading is based on a markdown file- look in `content/about/` to edit. There, look inside the `header`, `main`, and `sidebar` folders to get started building your own "about" page.
